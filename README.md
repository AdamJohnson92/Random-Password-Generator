## Usage

Users can interact with this web app to create a randomly generated password so that they can protect their login credentials from being guessed by bad actors. When clicking the Generate Password button, users will then be prompted to say how long they want their password to be. This will be a number between 8 and 128. After establishing the character length, users will be prompted to confirm which character types they want included in the password. The character types are Capital Letters, Lower Case Letters, Numbers, and Special Characters. After answering these prompts, the app will display the newly generated password for the user to copy and paste to their desired destination.
